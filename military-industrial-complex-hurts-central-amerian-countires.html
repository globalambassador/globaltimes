								<p>Many people believe that civil wars are caused by one country, but in reality other countries often provoke war to gain a profit. This is known as the military industrial complex and it played a huge role during the cold war. The cold war conflict between socialists and capitalists led waves of Central American refugees to seek asylum in the United States. For example, El Salvador had a civil war between socialist rebels and a capitalist government. To prevent the spread of communism and to feed the military industrial complex, the United States gave $4 billion in aid to El Salvador’s government. 70% of the aid was designated for military use. To put this in perspective, this is $2.8 billion dollars used for soldiers who were also trained in America to execute brutal violent repression against their own people. As a result, over 2 million Salvadorans immigrated to the United States, seeking asylum.</p>
								<p>In order to get further understanding about how El Salvador’s civil war had an affect on its people, we conducted two anonymous interviews on December 2, 2018. Interviewee A is a 52 year old woman who experienced the civil war first hand. Interviewee B is a 24 year old man who experienced the effects after the civil war. Interviewee A explains how the peace in her country became a living hell at the age of 14. She describes how the guerilla’s were evil because they had children become soldiers, so that they can have an upperhand in the war. In addition, she got post traumatic stress disorder from the civil war. Therefore, she decided that she didn’t want to live in a country full of violence and moved to the United States. When she came to this country she worked in a factory because she couldn’t get another job because she hadn’t had an education and roughly 20 years later she still lives in poverty, but knows that it is better than living in a country full of violence. Furthermore, Interviewee B emphasized how, after the civil war, gangs became a part of his life. Because the government had a weak and poor infrastructure, it became easy for these people to become corrupt. El Salvador is still a violent country, but this provides a further glance about how the military industrial complex had an impact on countries in Central America.</p>
								<p>Many American citizens believe that immigrants come to the U.S to take jobs from people and cause trouble. Furthermore, there was an economic effect due to immigration. Many of the immigrants were used as cheap “unskilled” labor. In fact, according to the statistics found in the <a href="https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/">New American Economy</a>, studies indicate that undocumented immigrants aren’t displacing U.S. born workers. As seen in the picture  above, there are 244,459 agricultural workers that are undocumented immigrants but make up the 36.1% of share workers. How undocumented immigrants help contribute to the economy is by them being accounted for 50% of all hired field and crop workers, making them essential to the success and continued viability of American farms. This shows a positive result towards undocumented immigrants instead of being portrayed as terrible people and people looking to steal job.</p>
								<p>To conclude, people have portrayed undocumented immigrants as people wanting to cause trouble and stealing job from others but that isn’t true. As you have read, the Cold War resulted to Central Americans emigrating to the U.S to seek for asylum. Undocumented immigrants pursued jobs that many American citizens weren’t to interested in. They have filled most of those jobs and that shows that they are willing to work wherever they have the opportunity to work at. What would America be like if undocumented people never did the work they have done for the past years? Would today’s economy be in serious trouble?</p>
