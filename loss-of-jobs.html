								<p>Recently in 2017, approximately 3 million Mexicans are living in the United States. But why is there a vast amount of Latin American immigrants? One of the cause was in 1992, president George  H.W. Bush, the Mexican president, Carlos Salinas, and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, agreed to sign the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA. According to the film Harvest of Empire by Juan Gonzalez, the purpose of NAFTA was to allow free trade among the three countries. Article 27 in the Mexican constitution, stated that only natural born Mexican citizens can have ownership of land. Because of this, Mexico had to eliminate Article 27 in the Mexican Constitution to allow foreign companies to purchase land and eliminate trade barriers. After NAFTA was passed, American corn farmers overthrew Mexican corn farmers with their mechanized and subsidized corn. The price of corn decreased by 50% and the price of tortilla rose by 40%. This led around 1.3 million Mexican farmers to sell their land for profit and soon jobless. However, NAFTA did create jobs in Mexico. Except, only a total of 0.5 million jobs were available. Since most of the jobs were in factories, the environment was dangerous and occasionally temporary. Overall, NAFTA only benefited industries, but not its citizens.</p>
								<h2>The Search for Jobs</h2>
								<p>Mrs. Perez is one of the numerous immigrants that arrived in the United States in search for a new job opportunity. She was born and raised in Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico. After she graduated from a four-year university with a major in teaching, she soon started to work at a primary school. She was earning nearly 700 pesos. It may sound as a large quantity, however in United States Dollars, it is equivalent to 30 dollars. When she earned her VISA card, she decided to travel to California. Eventually, she deliberated into moving to Los Angeles for the next upcoming years along with her husband. However her husband traveled by terrain to cross the border. Neither of them spoke or knew English. When they decided to live in the U.S. illegally, they were aware of the consequences and sacrifices they had to commit. Her first job in California was in a factory. Mrs. Perez states, “En 1995, trabajaba en un fábrica de telas. Me pagaban aproximadamente 7 dólares la hora. Pero a veces teníamos que poner una máscara para la boca porque no podíamos estar respirando el algodón que se soltaba de las machinas”. But soon later, these factories closed. She was left jobless and started to sell jewelry to people. Currently, Mrs. Perez is working as a housekeeper in Beverly Hills where she is earning just above the minimum wage at 12 dollars an hour. With the amount that she is earning in Los Angeles, it is barely enough to support herself and her family of four. Over the span of more than 20 years living in California, she has so far received a bump of 5 dollars in her salary earnings. Mrs. Perez four years in college became useless. Even teachers in Mexico can't properly live in their home country.</p>
								<p>An LAUSD teacher in the Los Angeles School of Global Studies is a first generation Mexican-American in the United States. Her parents and grandparents were born and raised in Zacatecas. Her grandparents, from her mother's side, had a difficult time living in Mexico. Her grandfather was in the Bracero Program which consisted of him leaving Mexico to the U.S. and coming back. The Bracero program occurred during the 1940s to mid-1960s where the United States brought millions of guest workers in agricultural labor contracts for a short-term. The Bracero Program was also another cause of why people had to emigrate from their own country. When he was away, the grandma would stay behind taking care of her 15 children. To sustain food and shelter, she had to make cheese and bread to sell people in Pueblo to make profit. In addition, they would include the money that the grandfather would make back in the U.S. Although it wasn't much in the U.S., it is in Mexico. This forced the older siblings from the 12, to go find a job in the U.S. to support their loved ones. In 1978, both of her parents decided to immigrate to the U.S. because ¨it was easier to raise a family here [U.S.] than in Mexico where there is a lot of poverty with no jobs¨ state the LAUSD teacher. Her mother’s first job was at a factory. She was making 10 cents per clothes. Her father was a welder. Soon after, both demanded a divorce, and the mother was left with her daughter. The family soon became homeless for three years. When the LASGS teacher turned 16, she had to work to support the rent and payments at a nearby job. Soon after, she attended college and got a degree in teaching in the U.S.</p>
								<h2>The Rise of Militarization in the US-Mexico Border</h2>
								<p>During the past decades, the Department of Homeland Security and several other security measures have been established after the terrific event of September 11, 2001. The teacher in L.A.S.G.S. described how her parents have immigrated to the U.S, has increased from the 1960s to now. “Border restrictions have gotten worse. A lot stronger. There are more cameras in different parts that are monitored by the U.S Border Patrol, virtual walls of sensors more helicopters. it is possible to come to the U.S but it has gotten harder.¨ In the 19’s there was a coyote that helps immigrants to come to the U.S. Since 1993, there are about 7,000 immigrants losing their lives crossing the border</p>
								<p>In conclusion, some might say that these immigrants are terrorists, bringing drugs, taking jobs away from Americans, etc. However, these immigrants, that are so-called ¨terrorists¨, are helping the economic system in the U.S. According to the New American Economy Website, undocumented workers in California alone generates nearly 1.3 billion dollars in taxes (2014). In total, these undocumented immigrants contributed around 13.5 billion dollars in the social security (2014). In addition, most undocumented workers are working in places where no American would want to work at. For example, many are working in agricultural, ground maintenance, service workers or helping the society. So in the end, without them, who would fill these types of jobs?</p>
