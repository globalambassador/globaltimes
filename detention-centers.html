								<p>Today, thousands of immigrants are suffering in private detention centers hosted by GEO, an organization that specializes in imprisoning immigrants. Immigrants that are fleeing from corruption, poverty, violence, that desire to live on better lives, wind up imprisoned and isolated from their families.
								<p>The U.S. currently holds large quantities of immigrant detainees. In fact, according to Freedom for Immigrants, “GEO Group and Corrections Corporation of America/CoreCivic together detain approximately 15,000 people in immigration detention per day.” The number of immigrant detainees continues to surge. Many immigrants are fleeing their countries for hope to live with peace here in the U.S. But then easy within private detention centers where hundreds of  thousands experience unfair treatment for long durations.</p>
								<p>Most detainees are imprisoned for years. In fact, approximately “48 percent of people we work with are held in immigration detention for 2 to 4 years, although about 5 percent of people are held in immigration detention for over 4 years.  Only about 7 percent of people we work with in immigration detention are held for less than 6 months”(CNN). These durations of imprisonment may seem unnecessary but makes sense. The longer these facilities imprison these immigrant detainees, the more profit these organizations gain. </p>
								<p>According to federal government data, GEO Group receives more taxpayer dollars for immigration detention than any other ICE contractor. In 2017, “GEO Group received $184 million, followed by Corrections Corporation of America/CoreCivic that received $135 million for immigration detention related service obligations” (Freedom of Immigrants).</p>
								<p>Detention centers are also abusive towards immigrant detainees. There are currently, “1,224 records of sexual assault in ICE detention” (The Intercept). It is common that imprisoned immigrants get assaulted within U.S. centers. Just recently’ “A former Cherokee County Detention Center officer has been indicted on assault charges after allegedly kicking an inmate in the face” (WUNC). Number of complaints against authorities continue to grow.</p>
								<p>Immigrant detainees are also put in unsanitary environments. “The mother arrived at the detention center in the midst of a chickenpox outbreak there, according to her attorney, Luis Cortez Romero” (CNN). Little to no care for ill detainees.</p>
								<p>Currently, immigrants are being abused and neglected within these detention facilities. This issue is expected to prolong and worsen as more immigrants come here to the United States of America.</p>
