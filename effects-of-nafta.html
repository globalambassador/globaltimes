								<p>One of the economic effects of immigration has definitely cheap labor. People who have immigrated to the United states choose to immigrate because the effects of the Free Trade Agreement offered more jobs that come with poor working conditions. Not only did NAFTA create jobs but it also caused 1.3 million Mexican farmers to abandon their plots. In January 1, 1994 NAFTA was created. This is an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America. NAFTA will increase migration by as many as 30 000 persons annually. Some may argue that immigration can have a negative impact on the countries economy but others may say it’s a good thing. A reason as to why immigration may have a negative impact economically is because the president starts spending large amounts of money on the securing the border. In 2003 the border was funded from $1.1 billion in 2001 to $1.5 billion in 2003. Others may say immigration has a good impact of the countries economy because detention centers make lots of money off of having these immigrants incarcerated.</p>
								<p><strong>Interview by Edith Ordonez</strong></p>
								<p> I interviewed my neighbor who is name Ruben and was told about many challenges he faced in Mexico. He talked about topics such as dehumanization and lack of jobs back in his home country and mistreatment and poor working conditions he faced when he immigrated to the US. I asked him “How were the working conditions and economy back in Mexico?” His response was “There was barely any jobs and the conditions were bad. People were losing their jobs and saw the United States as a country full of hope and dreams”. This proved our point of immigrants coming to the US for something better in life. I then continued with the interview and asked him “How was your journey coming to this country?” He then said “It was difficult we spent hours walking with no food and got to hostels where they would treat us poorly.” He then continued with saying “what made it more difficult was trying to cross with all the security the border.”. This proved my point of the country spending so much money on the security of the country making those who really need help make dangerous decisions all to cross the bored without getting caught. </p>
								<p>I continued with the interview and asked about how his life was as soon as he got to Los Angeles. The question I asked him was “How hard was it to get a job?” His response was “It wasn’t as hard because there are people who come look for workers at Home Depot and you can easily get a job there.” He mentioned the working conditions being bad and getting paid so little and having to have multiple jobs just to make enough for rent.</p>
								<p><strong>Interview by Noely Caballero</strong></p>
								<p>I interviewed my next door neighbor she was to remain anonymous I had a talk with her mostly on what she knows about NAFTA and she told me some interesting things that I myself didn’t know at all. She said that she knew Trump has threatened NAFTA and that congressional Republicans are warning trump to not withdraw from NAFTA with Mexico and Canada. She had come from Mexico and she had said that when she came her it was very hard for her to find a job until she finally found a friend who has helped her so much since. Americans jobs and food all went to Mexico because of NAFTA.</p>
								<p>--</p>
								<p>In conclusion, Immigration is simply increasing as the days go by. For example, the caravan that’s currently stuck in Tijuana. NAFTA was one of the causes as to why many Mexicans chose to immigrate to the states. Lack of jobs in the country meant less resources to make money and provide to families. People like Ruben came to this country facing many challenges such as dehumanization and taking any job that can potentially help bring food to the table. Poor working conditions, racism, and mistreatment isn’t something immigrants should face. After listening to Rubens story Americans blame immigrants for the “poor economy” and lack of jobs in the country, but the reality is that immigrants are willing to take any job no matter what it is in order to provide for their family something most Americans won't do. Being in America takes sacrifice and taking jobs with poor working conditions is one that most immigrants make.</p>
