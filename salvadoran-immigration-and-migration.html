								<p>Many Salvadorans migrate to the U.S. for many reasons, this leads to many economic effects. Some of the most significant causes of immigration is the military industrial complex and Cold War conflicts between capitalists and socialists. The Cold War sparked a nuclear arms race and a rise in defense spending that continued throughout the 1950’s and 1960’s. It affected Salvadorans because it led them to flee to the U.S. and once they arrived they did what they could to earn Temporary Protective Status (TPS). Salvadorans were allowed to work and live legally in the U.S. since their country was devastated by earthquakes in 2001.</p>
								<p>In the article Trump stated that nearly 200,000 Salvadorans Must Leave explains that many Saladorians were by far the largest group of foreigners benefiting from TPS , which shielded them from deportation if they had arrived in the United States illegally.</p>
								<p>The Trump Administration planned to end TPS for many immigrants. Many immigrants and citizens have pleaded to the United States to defend TPS. A quote in the article mentioned above states that “the Trump administration has been committed to reining in both legal and illegal immigration, most notably by ending protections for 800,000 young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, beginning in March unless Congress grants them legal status before then.” Not only do immigrants have their protection from deportation stripped, but their lives are being stripped away as well because they have created their lives in the U.S and now they have to leave everything behind.</p>
								<p>According to the article <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/02/22/salvadorans-will-lose-tps-status-heres-how-this-may-impact-the-countrys-march-elections/?utm_term=.ae26dff2c5c8">What will happen to El Salvador when the U.S. ends the protected status of Salvadoran immigrants?</a> from the Washington Post, “If the TPS program ends in September 2019, as currently planned, there are concerns that a drop in these remittances could result in increased poverty in El Salvador.” In this way, stripping TPS could inadvertently lead to a rise in the conditions that cause immigration in the first place. In addition, if immigrants are no longer provided with the protection of TPS then they are being forced to leave the country they came to in search of opportunity and being forced to return to countries they left, sometimes because they were escaping hardship, war, trauma and more.</p>
								<p>In a recent interview on December 4, 2018, Eduardo Diaz stated that he moved to the U.S sometime around the mid-1980s due to many events that were happening in Salvador that were too much to bare. Events such as natural disasters and the civil war led to the deaths of around 30,000 people who were killed by army-backed right-wing death squads. With all the events that had taken place, he had mixed feelings; at times, regretting his decision to leave Salvador to migrate to the U.S. He left so he can have a better future and start a new chapter in his life. However, there seemed to be part of him that regretted leaving because the rest of his family continues to live in Salvador and is forced to deal with unrest and hardship. Lastly, he shared his opinion on what Donald Trump stated about wanting 200,000 Salvadorans to leave the country by saying,  ̈Immigrants come to the U.S seeking opportunity, seeking the dreams they’ve always wanted to have but could never reach. Everything we have isn't handed to us so easily, we have to work for what we have and coming to the U.S gives us that opportunity. So for Donald Trump to tell us to leave isn’t it, and we aren't going to take it ̈. </p>
