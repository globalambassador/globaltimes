								<p>Many Salvadorans migrate to the U.S due to many causes which lead to many economic effects. A cause of immigration being Military Industrial Complex and Cold War conflicts between Capitalists and Socialists. The Cold War sparked a nuclear arms race and an act of defense spending that continued throughout the 1950’s and 1960’s. It affected Salvadorans because it led them to flee to the U.S, and once they arrive they do what they can to earn TPS.</p>
								<p>In the article “Trump Administration says that nearly 200,000 Salvadorans must leave” by The New York Times, provides information about Salvadorans. They were by far the largest group of foreigners benefiting from TPS (temporary protected status), which shielded them from deportation if they had arrived in the United States illegally. </p>
								<p>The Trump Administration planned to end TPS for many immigrants. Many have pleaded to the United States such as immigrants and the Salvadoran government. In this quote it states “But the Trump administration has been committed to reining in both legal and illegal immigration, most notably by ending protections for 800,000 young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, beginning in March unless Congress grants them legal status before then”. This quote reveals that not only are immigrants being stripped away from their protection status but their lives are being stripped away as well.</p>
								<p>According to the Washington Post “If the TPS program ends in September 2019, as currently planned, there are concerns that a drop in these remittances could result in increased poverty in El Salvador”. This quote reveals that if immigrants are no longer provided with the protection of TPS then they are being forced to leave the country they came to search opportunity for, they will be going back to their home country.</p>
								<p>In a recent interview with Eduardo Diaz on December 4, 2018, he stated that he moved to the U.S sometime around the mid 1980s due to many events that were happening in Salvador that was too much to handle. Events such as natural disasters and the civil war which led to the deaths of around 30,000 people, killed by army-backed right-wing death squads. Including, with all the events that have taken place he has mixed feelings about regretting his decision about leaving Salvador to migrate to the U.S. He left so he can have a better future and start a new chapter in his life but also, regrets leaving because the rest of his family is still in Salvador dealing with problems of their own. Lastly, he shared his opinion based on what Donald Trump stated about wanting 200,000 Salvadorans to leave the country by saying, ¨Immigrants come to the U.S seeking opportunity, seeking the dreams they´ve always wanted to have but could never reach. Everything we have isn't handed to us so easily, we have to work for what we have and coming to the U.S gives us that opportunity. So for Donald Trump to tell us to leave isn't it, and we aren't going to take it¨.</p>
