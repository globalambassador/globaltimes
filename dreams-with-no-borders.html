								<p>The United States; many see it as the land of opportunity, liberty, and happiness. However, with the rise of mass deportation and detention of asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border, immigrants are now seen as miscreants by the current administration. President Trump has emphasized how important it is to keep American soil safe from terror or other harms, yet he does so with clear anti-immigrant rhetoric. Despite security being crucial, the executive branch of our country may not be open to explore the reasons for the increasing immigration, particularly from Latin American countries. More importantly, it is a challenge to acknowledge the impact undocumented immigrants have in the U.S. economy. Are they really “rapists, drug dealers and criminals”?</p>
								<h2>Seeking A Better Life</h2>
								<p>Sara Shakir was fed up of the corruption and impunity in Mexico during the 1980’s, “It was a complete mess… privatization was expanding and the idea that a neoliberal trade agreement was close to being a reality simply scared me.” Mexico’s classism was a huge issue, the then president Miguel de la Madrid failed to industrialized the republic and was involved in scandals of money laundering. <a href="https://www.animalpolitico.com/2012/04/como-fue-el-sexenio-de-miguel-de-la-madrid-2/">Animal Politico</a> reports that the inflation also grew by 4,030%. The Mexico City earthquake of 1985 was the pinnacle of disaster. Shakir decided to leave the Mexican capital in 1988 for a life free of oppression, her destination was the country who was shortly going to experience an economic boom. Shakir got a job as a car washer in Los Angeles, California and lived paycheck-to-paycheck. “It was tough, but I would’ve been worse if I had stayed in Mexico since NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] literally eliminated job opportunities for a lot of Mexicans… I would’ve most likely been unemployed or working as a slave for twelve hours a day up northern Mexico making clothes.”</p>
								<p>Poverty and corruption were Mexico’s main issues during the 1980’s, but Maria M. Mena had a more horrifying experience in El Salvador. The civil war was a twelve-year conflict between the conservative government and the Farabundo Marti Liberacion Nacional (FMLN) rebels. Wealth, power, and classism were the government standards, anyone who wanted democracy or an economic reform was killed by death squads. The Salvadoran rule was supported by the U.S. as they feared any possible spread of communism and socialism. America aided El Salvador with $4 billion during the 1980’s, 70% was spent on weapons and the military. Maria Mena’s teenage years were lived in fear, “I would have to hide in other people’s houses because the military was looking for my brother and my parents were afraid that if they didn’t find him they would end up taking me away.” Mena was oblivious of the U.S. involvement in the civil war, yet she decided to flee north. She now works as a janitor and sends money to her loved ones back in El Salvador.</p>
								<p>Violence was the last thing both individuals would want to be part of, especially in the land where they now reside.</p>
								<h2>The Unsung Heroes Of The Economic Boom</h2>
								<p>Immigration from Latin America to the U.S. skyrocketed during the end of the 1980’s. By the start of the 1990’s, most undocumented immigrants were seeking for jobs or already were part of cheap labor. The production of goods and services increased, resulting in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) moving from -1.81% to 3.14%. This growth can be highly attributed to undocumented immigrants who worked jobs that many Americans would probably not want to have, otherwise such jobs would have remained vacant.</p>
								<p>The <a href="https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/issues/undocumented-immigrants/">New American Economy</a> reported that by 2013 86.6% of undocumented males in America were of working age, laboring in jobs that paid low wages. By 2014, the share of undocumented workers in the U.S. were broken down into various occupations: 36.1% did agriculture, 26.7% maintenance, 25.1% food service, 19% were cleaners, the list goes on. Both Shakir and Mena were part of the cheap labor that contributed to the American surplus of the last decades.</p>
								<p>Most undocumented Latin American immigrants are not criminals, as proven by recent statistical reports. The anti-immigrant rhetoric from the president needs reconsideration. In fact, the crime rate in the U.S. decreased by 48% during the period of time of mass immigration from Latin America. Still, recognizing the economic benefits undocumented immigrants have brought to the U.S. is not enough to fully understand their circumstances. It is essential to get informed on why they came to this country in the first place.</p>
