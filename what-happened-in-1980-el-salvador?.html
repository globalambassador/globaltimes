								<p><strong>Intro:</strong> Gianni Madera</p>
								<p>In 1980, A civil war had commenced in El Salvador. The civil war and subsequent mass migration within El Salvador occured due to the effort to spread capitalism by force. As a result of the clash between economic systems and the military-led government failing to fulfill promises (such as improving living conditions), there followed the formation of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). El Salvador’s military government suppressed socialist groups, such as the FMLN with aid from the U.S. in ways that were inhumane. For example, huge massacres of innocents and mass torture. Ultimately, the civil war shifted economic focus away from any social services.</p>
								<p><strong>Causes of The Civil War:</strong> Fredi Juarez</p>
								<p>The cause of the civil war stems from the military junta’s promise that the people of El salvador would enjoy better living conditions. The junta’s failure to fulfil their promise led to the birth of the FMLN. The FMLN took over large sections of Monazan and Chalatenango, which lead to terrorizing and targeting of many civilians by death squads. Bishop Romero was killed due to his peaceful efforts to stop the violence and killing of innocent people. During Oscar Romeroś funeral, a bomb was set off. The state armed forces responded by opening fire against the multitude killing around 30 people and injuring 200 more.</p>
								<p><strong>Causes of Immigration:</strong> Gianni Madera</p>
								<p>Due to the socialist rebel group and its violent protests against their government, the Salvadoran military-led government depended on torturing and mass killings in order to suppress the violence that was endorsed by FMLN. In addition, a majority of the population lived deep in poverty, which led to vast poor living conditions. According to <a href="http://harvestofempiremovie.com/synopsis/">Harvest of Empire</a> 70% of the country’s money was used for weapons and military. Less funding went into human capital, which resulted in people migrating for better opportunities, such as better living conditions and stable jobs that pay well. According to Juan Gonzalez, “The causes of immigration now are very similar to the causes then -- extreme poverty in El Salvador, which is made worse because U.S. companies only go down there to take back as much wealth as they can, so they leave little money for the workers in their plants to survive on; violence against the people, whether from the government or from street gangs that are often allowed to commit their crimes by corrupt police and soldiers.”</p>
								<p><strong>Economic Effects of Immigration:</strong> Gianni Madera</p>
								<p>Often, Immigrants are exploited for their much needed labor in the United States. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/02/nafta-trade-deal-mexico-immigrants">The US-Mexico trade deal leaves out one important group: Immigrants</a> by Gene Marks reveals that “Unemployment is low and at the same time immigration laws have been tightened to restrict access to both skilled and unskilled workers that provide much of the low-level work that underlies the economy.” The U.S. is in need of low skilled labor and the demand will only increase due to newer generations of U.S. citizens receiving higher education and obtaining jobs that require more skill. Due to fear of deportation, many immigrants are easily exploited by employers that use the fact that they are undocumented as a threat. Immigrants often receive less pay and have no say due to the fear of deportation. Detention centers in the U.S. that contain immigrants also benefit from immigration financially. Often, immigrants held in these detention centers are also used for their labor and receive very low wages.</p>
								<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Gianni Madera</p>
								<p>The director of Harvest of Empire, Juan Gonzalez was able to enlighten us even further with his responses after we reached out to him. Juan Gonzalez claims that the “The impact of the civil war there is still having an effect -- both in the U.S. and in El Salvador. Many Salvadoran families that migrated here in the 1980s had been traumatized by the war. Their children who came here when they were very young were deeply affected by the violence, and several of the early Salvadoran street gangs that arose in Los Angeles and other cities actually had as leaders young Salvadorans who had participated in the violence back home. Before long, young Salvadorans were being to jail for gang violence and drugs, and when they finished their time in prison, the federal government immediately deported them back to El Salvador. But they had never been rehabilitated while in jail, so when they were sent back to El Salvador -- a country they barely know because they had grown up in the U.S. -- they slipped back into gang life, but now they were terrorizing people in their own country.” According to Juan Gonzalez, “Modern El Salvador is slightly better off than the country was in the 1980s. But a big reason for that is all the money that Salvadorans in the U.S. send back to their families every month (all those money orders for $100 or $150 a month they send to their grandmothers, their children and aunts and uncles to help them survive). The money sent to Salvadorans from relatives in the U.S. is the number one source of revenue for the country. In 2016, according to one report, El Salvador received $4.5 billion from Salvadorans living abroad.” Juan Gonzalez also provided a link to this report: <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/remittances-to-el-salvador-surge-to-record-high-in-2016/3689072.html">Remittances to El Salvador Surge to Record High in 2016.</a></p>
